At this stage of the project, all solutions proposed during the problem-solving phase are evaluated for practical feasibility based on technical and business requirements.

The evaluation criteria often include technical and production constraints, time-to-market requirements, as well as investment and cost limitations, among others. The highest-scoring solutions are selected and recommended for further development â€“ or for additional assessment if deemed necessary. This process efficiently filters out the best solutions, optimizing resources and time.
