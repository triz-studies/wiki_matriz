<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/3stages_pr-sol-1024x76.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Problem-solving tools represent a set of instruments designed to address specific&nbsp;key problems identified during the problem-identification stage of the project.</p>
<p>The following model serves as the foundation for every problem-solving process according to TRIZ:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/prob-sol_mod-1024x266.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the first step, a specific key problem is transformed into a model of the problem. This model is then processed using a tool dedicated to that particular model to generate a solution model. Finally, a brainstorming is conducted around the generated solution model to develop concrete solution concepts.</p>
<p>The problem-solving tools are grouped into two blocks: those that require the formulation of contradictions (engineering or physical) and those that have nothing to do with contradictions:</p>
<p><strong>contradiction required</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ARIZ</li>

<h1>Substance-field modeling</h1>
<p>Substance-field modeling, like contradictions&nbsp;application, is used to model a problem identified in the analytical phase of the project. However, it offers a different perspective on the problem compared to contradictions.</p>
<p>Basic assumption in the approach is that a minimally functioning system must consist of 3 basic elements:<br>
1. 2 substances (S), i.e., objects with a rest mass involved in the system, and<br>
2. a field (F), i.e., entity without a rest mass that establishes an interaction between substances.</p>
<p>The substances are closely related to the key problem that needs to be solved. They can refer to microscopic objects, single components, or the entire technical system.&nbsp;The field is typically one of the types selected from the MATChEM model.</p>
<p>Abstracting them presents a simple visual format of the key problem that needs to be solved:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/su-field_basic.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In classical TRIZ, the tool used to identify the substances and fields needed to create a Su-Field of the problem was substance-field analysis. Today, this tool is no longer in use, as key disadvantages identified during CECA provide detailed information for this purpose.</p>
<p>The tool designed for processing the substance-field models (Su-Fields) of problems is the system of 76 standard inventive solutions (SIS), which leads to solution models represented by selected SISs. In some cases, these solutions can also be presented in the form of Su-Fields. Thus, substance-field analysis is the only TRIZ tool where the model of solution can have the same form as a model the problem.</p>

<h1>Standard inventive solutions (SIS)</h1>
<p><em><strong>Standard inventive solutions (SIS)</strong> are a set of 76 typical solution models, to typical problem models that are expressed in the form of substance-field (Su-Field) models.</em></p>
<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The system of standard inventive solutions (SIS) is a collection of 76 typical technical solutions, developed in the form of substance-field models&nbsp;(so called Su-Fields)&nbsp;representing interactions between substances and fields. It serves as a tool for analyzing and generating solutions to engineering problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system was created by Genrikh Altshuller, who, through the analysis of thousands of patents, identified recurring patterns in problem-solving across various technical fields.&nbsp;The history of SIS dates back to the 1970s, when Altshuller and his team developed the first set of 28 standard solutions based on the Su-Field model. The system was further expanded throughout the 1980s, culminating in a set of 76 standards, which Altshuller deemed sufficiently complete. However, he did not rule out the possibility of further expanding the system in the future.</p>
<p>Thus, the list of standard inventive solutions is not finite. Theoretically, new recommendations could be discovered and added, based on emerging technologies and evolving trends in engineering. Nonetheless, the current collection provides a robust foundation for addressing a wide range of technical challenges.</p>

<section id="structure-of-the-system" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structure-of-the-system">Structure of the system</h2>
<p>The system of standard inventive solutions contains 76 SISs, which are organized into five classes. Providing the logical structure facilitates efficient navigation and application of solutions to specific types of engineering problems:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="class-1-building-and-destruction-of-su-fields">Class 1: Building and destruction of Su-Fields</h3>
<p>SISs from Class 1 are used to resolve engineering problems by improving interactions and eliminating harmful effects. They are focused on constructing or destroying Su-Field models if the models are incomplete (S1, S2, or F is missing), complete but not working (F is inadequate), or harmful.</p>
<p>The class contains 2 sub-classes and 13 SISs.</p>
<section id="synthesis-of-a-substance-field-system" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="synthesis-of-a-substance-field-system">1.1. Synthesis of a substance-field system</h4>
<p>The main idea of this sub-class is clearly reflected in SIS 1.1.1: for the synthesis of a workable technical system, it is necessary – in the simplest case – to go from incomplete Su-Field to complete Su-Field. Often, constructing the Su-Field encounters difficulties due to various restrictions on the introduction of substances and fields. Standards 1.1.2 through 1.1.8 show typical workarounds in such cases.</p>
<p>1.1.1. Synthesis of a substance-field system</p>
<p>If there is an object that is not easy to change as required, and the conditions do not contain any limitations on introducing substances and fields, solve the problem by synthesizing an SIS, i.e., by introducing the missing element(s).</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_1-1-1-e1738249667390.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>1.1.2. Improving interactions by introducing additives into the objects</p>
<p>If there is a Su-Field that is difficult to be changed, and there are no restrictions on introducing additives into the available substances, the problem is being solved by transition to the internal complex Su-Field, i.e., by introducing an internal additive to S1 or S2. That increases the controllability or adds the necessary properties to the Su-Field. The additive can be added permanently or temporarily.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_1-1-2-e1738249711879.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>S1 is a product, S2 is a tool, S3 is an additive. Brackets denote an inner compound bond (an outer compound bond is denoted without brackets).</p>
<p>1.1.3. Improving interactions by introducing additives into the system</p>
<p>If there is a Su-Field that is difficult to be changed, and there are no restrictions on introducing additives into the available substances, the problem is being solved by transition to the external complex Su-Field, i.e., by introducing an external additive to S1 or S2. That increases the controllability or adds the necessary properties to the Su-Field. The additive can be added permanently or temporarily.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_113-e1738249752718.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>1.1.4. Use the environment to improve interactions</p>
<p>If there is a Su-Field that is difficult to be changed, and there are no restrictions on introducing additives into the available substances, the problem is being solved by introducing an additive that is a part of the environment or the supersystem.</p>
<p>1.1.5. Modify the environment to improve interactions</p>
<p>If the external environment does not contain ready substances required to synthesize a Su-Field, these substances can be obtained by replacing the external environment with another one, or by decomposing the environment, or by introducing additives into the environment.</p>
<p>1.1.6. Providing minimal effect of action</p>
<p>If a minimal (measured, optimal) effect of action is required, but it is difficult or impossible to provide it under the conditions of the problem, use a maximal action (either of a field or a substance) while the excess is then removed. Substance excess is removed by a field, while field excess is removed by a substance. The excess is shown by a double line.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_116-e1738249908434.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>1.1.7. Providing maximal effect of action</p>
<p>If a maximal effect of action on a substance is required and this is not allowed, the maximal action has to be preserved but directed to another substance attached to the first one.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_117-e1738249884887.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>1.1.8. Use the selectively maximal mode</p>
<p>If a selectively maximal action is required (maximal in certain zones, while maintaining the minimal in other zones), the field should be maximal, but:</p>
<p><strong>1.1.8.1. Selectively maximal mode: maximal field</strong></p>
<p>In the first case, we introduce a protective substance where it is necessary to maintain minimal action.</p>
<p><strong>1.1.8.2. Selectively maximal mode: minimal field</strong></p>
<p>In the second case, while having the minimal mode, we selectively introduce substances that locally generate an additional field, for example, thermit compaunds – for thermal action, explosive compaunds for mechanical action.</p>

<section id="destroy-su-fields" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="destroy-su-fields">1.2. Destroy Su-Fields</h4>
<p>Sub-class 1.2. includes SISs for destruction of Su-Fields and the elimination or neutralization of harmful effects within them.<br>
The strongest idea of this sub-class is the mobilization of the necessary elements through the use of the available substance-field resources.<br>
Standard 1.2.2 is particularly important. According to it, functions of a new substance are performed by modified substances already present in the system.</p>
<p>1.2.1. Eliminate harmful interaction by introducing a foreign substance</p>
<p>If useful and harmful actions appear between two substances in a substance-field system and there is no need to maintain a direct contact between the substances, solve the problem by introducing a third substance between them. The substance should be free or sufficiently cheap.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_121-e1738250033385.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The wavy arrow indicates an action that has to be eliminated.</p>
<p>1.2.2. Eliminate harmful interaction by modifying existing substances</p>
<p>If there are useful and harmful actions between two substances, and there is no need to maintain direct contact between the substances, and it is forbidden or inconvenient to use foreign substances, solve the problem by introducing a third substance between the two. In this case, the third substance is to be a modification of the first or second substances.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_122-e1738250190313.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note: S3 can be introduced into the system as a ready substance from the supersystem or it can be obtained (by the action of F1 or F2) from S1 or S2. In particular, S3 can be a „void”, bubbles, foam, etc.</p>
<p>1.2.3. Eliminate harmful action of a field by introducing a sacrificial substance</p>
<p>If it is necessary to eliminate the harmful action of a field upon a substance, the problem can be solved by introducing a second substance that draws off upon itself the harmful effect of the field.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_123-e1738250276243.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>1.2.4. Eliminate harmful effects by a new counteracting field</p>
<p>If useful and harmful action appear between two substances in a Su-Field, and a direct contact between the substances must be maintained, the problem can be solved by transitioning to a dual substance-field system — the useful effect is provided by the existing field while a new counteracting field neutralizes the harmful action (or transforms the harmful action into a useful action).</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_124-e1738250582262.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>1.2.5. “Turning off” a magnetic field</p>
<p>If it is necessary to destroy a Su-Field with a magnetic field, the problem is solved by using physical effects that are capable of “switching off” ferromagnetic properties of substances (e.g., by de-magnetizing by a mechanical impact or by heating above the Curie point).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="class-2-development-of-su-fields">Class 2: Development of Su-Fields</h3>
<p>Class 2 of standard inventive solutions is used to improve the efficiency of the engineering system by introducing minor modifications.</p>
<p>This class contains 4 sub-classes and 23 SISs.</p>
<section id="transition-to-more-sophisticated-su-field" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transition-to-more-sophisticated-su-field">2.1. Transition to more sophisticated Su-Field</h4>
<p>An increase of the efficiency of Su-Fields can be achieved by the transition from simple Su-Fields to more sophisticated ones – chain and double ones. The modifications are relatively small, while the transition ensures the emergence of new qualities and strengthening of the existing ones, primarily the controllability of the system.</p>
<p>2.1.1. Transition to chain Su-Field</p>
<p>If it is necessary to increase the efficiency of the Su-Field, the problem can be solved by transforming S1 or S2 into an independently controlled Su-Field, thus creating a chain Su-Field.</p>
<p>S3 or S4 can be transformed into another independently controlled Su-Field.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_211-e1738250650897.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>2.1.2. Transition to double Su-Field</p>
<p>If the Su-Field is insufficient and the replacement of its elements is unacceptable, the problem can be solved by introducing a second field, hence constructing a double Su-Field that has higher efficiency.</p>

</section>
<section id="intensification-of-su-fields" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intensification-of-su-fields">2.2. Intensification of Su-Fields</h4>
<p>The general idea behind six SIS of this sub-class is to increase the efficiency of Su-Fields – simple or more sophisticated – without introducing any new fields or substances. This is achieved by the intensified use of the available substance-field resources.</p>
<p>2.2.1. Transition to more controllable fields</p>
<p>An efficiency of Su-Field can be increased by replacing the uncontrolled (or poorly controlled) field with a controlled (well-controlled) field, e.g., replacing the gravity field with a mechanical, mechanical-electric, etc.</p>
<p>2.2.2. Segmentation of the substance</p>
<p>An efficiency of Su-Field can be improved by increasing the degree of segmentation of S1 or S2.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_222-e1738250858175.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The symbol&nbsp;Sm&nbsp;denotes a substance segmented into many small particles (grains of sand, powder, granules, etc.).</li>
<li>SIS 2.2.1 reflects one of the sub-trends of TESE, i.e, the segmentation of components.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.2.3. Transition to capillary-porous substance</p>
<p>A special case of substances segmentation is the transition from solids to capillary-porous substances. This transition is performed along the following line:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_223-a-e1738250933523.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>monolith substance</p>
<p>substance with one cavity</p>
<p>monolith with many cavities (perforated substance)</p>
<p>capillary-porous substance</p>
<p>capillary-porous substance with a certain pore structure (and size)</p>
<p>With the development of this line, the possibility of introducing a liquid substance into cavities-pores and using physical effects increases.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_223-b-e1738250954649.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>2.2.4. Dynamization of the Su-Field</p>
<p>Efficiency of a Su-Field can be improved by increasing the degree of its dynamization, i.e., by transitioning to a more flexible, rapidly changing structure of the system.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_224-e1738251000430.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;A triangular symbol with a wavy line represents a dynamic Su-Field that changes during its operation.<br>
The dynamization of&nbsp;S2&nbsp;usually start with introducing a hinge. Further dynamization runs along the line: one hinge -&gt; many hinges -&gt; flexible substance.<br>
The dynamization of F usuall transition from the constant F to pulsating F.</p>
<p>2.2.5. Changing the structure of the field</p>
<p>Efficiency of Su-Field can be increased by transitioning from homogeneous or unstructured field to inhomogeneous field or a field with a special structure (constant or variable in time and space).</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_225-e1738251023830.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note: The # symbol next to the letter F denotes that the field has a special structure variable in time and space.<br>
If a substance that is a part of the Su-Field or can be a part of the Su-Field mut have a specific spatial structure, the process should be performed in a field that has a structure corresponding to the required structure of the substance.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_225_b-e1738251042647.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>2.2.6. Changing the structure of the substance</p>
<p>Efficiency of Su-Field can be increased by transitioning from homogeneous or unstructured substance to inhomogeneous substance or a substance with a special structure (constant or variable in time and space).</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_226-e1738251202221.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note: The # symbol next to the letter S denotes that the substance has a special structure variable in time and space.<br>
If it is necessary to obtain an intensive thermal effect in the certain places of the system (points, lines), exothermic substances should be introduced in these places beforehand.</p>
</section>
<section id="intensification-of-rhythms-coordination" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intensification-of-rhythms-coordination">2.3. Intensification of rhythms coordination</h4>
<p>Sub-class 2.3 includes SISs for Su-Fields intensification in particularly economical ways. Instead of introducing or substantially changing substances or fields, the SISs provide for purely quantitative changes – frequencies, sizes, or mass. Thus, a significant new effect is achieved with minimal system changes.</p>
<p>2.3.1. Coordination of rhythms of the field and the substance</p>
<p>Efficiency of Su-Field can be improved by coordination of the frequency of the Field with the natural frequency of the Substance.</p>
<p>2.3.2. Coordination of rhythms of the fields that are used</p>
<p>In more sophisticated Su-Field, the frequencies of the Fields that are used should be coordinated.</p>
<p>2.3.3. Coordination of incompatible or previously independent activities</p>
<p>When two activities, e.g., changing and measuring, are incompatible, one activity can be performed in the pauses of the other. Important: pauses in one action should be filled with the other action.</p>

<section id="fe-fields-intensified-sophisticated-su-fields" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fe-fields-intensified-sophisticated-su-fields">2.4. Fe-Fields (intensified sophisticated Su-Fields)</h4>
<p>Fe-Field is a Su-Field where one of the Substances is segmented, has magnetic properties and at least one Field is electromagnetic.</p>
<p>Intensification can be performed through several typical ways simultaneaously. Su-Fields where the magnetis Substance is segmented is the easiest to intensify.</p>
<p>2.4.1. Transition to Proto-Fe-Field</p>
<p>Efficiency of Su-Field can be improved by using a ferromagnetic Substance (as one piece) and a magnetic Field.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_241-e1738251265362.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note: This is the SIS that uses ferromagnetic Substance that is not segmented. We talk about the Proto-Fe-Field and other intermediate states.</p>
<p>This SIS is applicable not only for simple Su-Fields but also to complex (with an additive), as well as for Su-Fields where the additive is a part of the environment.</p>
<p>2.4.2. Transition to Fe-Field</p>
<p>Efficiency of Su-Field can be improved by transition from Su-Field or Proto-Fe-Field to Fe-Field by replacing one of the substances with ferro-particles (or adding ferro-particles like chips, granules, grains, etc.) and using a magnetic or an electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>The controlability grows with the increase of the degree of the ferro-particles fragmentation, so the development of Fe-Fields follows the line:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_242_a-e1738218425147.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>granules</p>
<p>powder</p>
<p>finely dispersed ferro-particles</p>
<p>The controlability also grows with the increase in the degree of fragmentation of the substance into which the ferro-particles are introduced. The development follows the line:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_242_b-e1738218581240.png" class="img-fluid">monolith substance</p>

<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_242_c-e1738251304436.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Transition to Fe-Field can be considered a joint application for two SIS – 2.4.1 (Transition to Proto-Fe-Field) and 2.2.2 (Segmentation of the substance).</p>
<p>Having turned into Fe-Field, the Su-Field repeats the development cycle, however, at a new level, since Fe-Fields can be characterized by high controllability and efficiency. The SISs of sub-class 2.4 can be considered as types of „isotopes” of SISs of sub-classes 2.1-2.3. Singling out Fe-Fields into their own sub-class is justified (at least at this stage of SIS development) by the exceptional practical significance of Fe-Fields. Additionally, Fe-Fields are more precise research tool for studying rougher Su-Fields and predicting their development.</p>
<p>2.4.3. Using ferromagnetic fluids</p>
<p>Efficiency of Fe-Field can be improved by the use of ferromagnetic fluids – colloidal ferro-particles suspended in kerosene, silicone, or water. SIS 2.4.3 can be seen as a last point in the development according to SIS 2.4.2.</p>
<p>2.4.4. Using capillary-porous substances in Fe-Fields</p>
<p>Efficiency of Fe-Fields can be improved by using a capillary-porous structure that is characteristic for many Fe-Fields.</p>
<p>2.4.5. Transition to complex Fe-Field</p>
<p>If it is necessary to increase a controllability of the system by transition to Fe-Field, and the replacement of substances by ferro-particles is unacceptable, the transition is performed by introducing additives to one of the substances, hence creating an internal or external complex Fe-Field.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_245-e1738219108738.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>2.4.6. Transition to Fe-Field using the external environment</p>
<p>If it is necessary to increase a controllability of the system by transition from Su-Field to Fe-Field, and replacing the substance with ferro-particles (or adding additives to the substance) is unacceptable, then the ferro-particles should be introduced into the external environment and control the system by the magnetic field, hence changing the environment parameters (SIS 2.4.3).</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_246-e1738219356541.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Electrorheological fluids controlled by electric fields can also be used as an external environment.</p>
<p>2.4.7. Using physical effects</p>
<p>It is possible to controll Fe-Fields using physical effects.</p>
<p>2.4.8. Dynamization of the Fe-Field</p>
<p>Efficiency of Fe-Field can be improved by increasing the degree of its dimization, i.e., by transitioning to a more flexible, rapidly changing structure of the system.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_248-e1738219703170.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>2.4.9. Changing the Fe-Field structure</p>
<p>Efficiency of Fe-Field can be increased by transitioning from homogeneous field to inhomogeneous one or from an unstructured field or a field with a special structure (constant or variable in time and space).</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SIS_249-e1738219807601.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>2.4.10. Coordination of rhythms of the Fe-Field</p>
<p>Efficiency of Proto-Fe-Field and Fe-Field can be improved by coordinating rythms of its elements.</p>
<p>2.4.11. Transition to E-Field (Su-Field with interacting electrical currents)</p>
<p>If the introduction of ferromagnets or magnetization of substances is difficult, the interaction of an external electromagnetic field with the direct contact, or induced currents, or the interaction of these currents with each other should be used.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If Fe-Fields are SISs with ferromagnetic particles, then E-Fields are SISs with currents or interacting currents instead of ferromagnetic particles.</li>
<li>Development of E-Field – similar to Fe-Fields – repeats the general line of Su-Field evolution:</li>

<p>A special type of E-Fields are Su-Fields with electro-rheological suspension (fine non-conducting but electrically active particles), with controlled viscosity. If the ferromagnetic fluids cannot be used, the electro-rheological suspension can be applied.</p>

<p>Class 3 of standard inventive solutions applies to the engineering systems which performance is <strong>insufficient</strong>. Their efficiency is improved by developing solutions on the different system levels, like the level of supersystem or the microlevel.</p>
<p>This class contains 2 sub-classes and 6 SISs.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transition-to-bi--and-poly-systems">3.1. Transition to bi- and poly-systems</h4>
<p>Along with the internal improvement (SISs of Class2), there is a line of external development: at any stage of the internal development, the system can be intergrated with the supersystem components obtaining a new quality.</p>
<p>3.1.1. Transition to bi- and poly-systems</p>
<p>At any stage of the development, efficiency of Su-Field can be increased by the integration of the system with another system (or systems) into a more sophisticated bi-system or a poly-system (system transition 1a).</p>
<p>3.1.2. Development of links in bi-systems and poly-systems</p>
<p>Increasing the efficiency of the synthesized bi-systems and poly-systems can be achieved primarily through the development of links between elements of Su-Field.</p>
<p>The newly developed bi-systems and poly-systems often have „no links”, that is, they are just a „pile” of components. The development is aimed at strengthening linking. On the other hand, elements in newly created systems are sometimes connected by rigid links. In these cases, the development is aimed at increasing the degree of dynamization of links.</p>

<p>3.1.3. Increasing the difference between the elements of bi-systems and poly-systems</p>

<p>inverse combinations of the „element and anti-element”</p>
<p>3.1.4. Trimming of bi-systems and poly-systems</p>
<p>Efficiency of bi-systems and poly-systems can be improved by Trimming. Completely trimmed bi-systems and poly-systems become monosystems again. The cycle can be repeated.</p>
<p>3.1.5. Opposite properties of the system and its parts</p>
<p>Efficiency of bi-systems and poly-systems can be improved by distributing opposite properties in the system and among its parts. A two-level system is used in which the entire system has property C, and its parts (particles) have property anti-C (system transition 1c).</p>

<p>When creating, restructuring, or destroing Su-Fields, it is often necessary to introduce new substance. That will deacrease the ideality of the system. Therefore, substances must be „introduced without introducing” and various bypasses should be used.</p>
<p>5.1.1. Bypass</p>
<p>If it is necessary to introduce a substance into the system, and this is prohibited by the problem constraints or is unacceptable due to the operating conditions, then bypasses should be used.</p>
<p><strong>5.1.1.1. Using a void instead of substance</strong></p>

<p><strong>5.1.1.3. Using an external additive instead of an internal one</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1.1.4. Using very small doses of a particularly active additive</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1.1.5. Using very small doses of a usual additive, but concentrated in separate parts of the object</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1.1.6. Using an additive for some time</strong></p>

<p><strong>5.1.1.9. The additive is obtained by decomposition of an external environment or the object itself, for example, by electrolysis, or by changing the state of aggregate of the external environment or the part of the object</strong></p>
<p>5.1.2. Separating the product into interacting parts</p>
<p>If it is difficult to transform Su-Field and the problem conditions do not allow to replace the tool or to introduce additives, use the product instead of the tool, dividing it into parts that interact with each other.</p>
<p>5.1.3. Using a substance for a limited time</p>
<p>After the action, the substance introduced into the system should disappear or become indistinguishable from the substance that has previously been in the system or in the external environment.</p>
<p>5.1.4. Using inflatable structures and foam</p>

<p>5.4.1. Using the reversible physical transformations</p>
<p>If an object must periodically be in different physical states, then the transition should be accomplished by the object itself by means of reversible physical transformations, e.g., phase transitions, ionization-recombination, dissociation-association etc.</p>
<p>5.4.2. Strengthening the output field</p>
<p>If a strong output action is required while the input action is weak, the converter-substance should be brought to a near critical state. Energy is stored in the substance and the input signal acts as a „trigger”.</p>

<p>5.5.1. Obtaining the substance particles by decomposition</p>
<p>If particles of the substance (i.e., ions) are needed to solve the problem, and their direct generation is impossible due to the problem constraints, then the required particles must be obtained by destroying a substance of a higher structural level (i.e., molecules).</p>
<p>5.5.2. Obtaining the substance particles by combining</p>
<p>If particles of the substance (i.e., molecules) are needed to solve the problem and it is impossible to obtain them directly or according to SIS 5.5.1, then the required particles have to be generated by completing or combining particles of a lower structural level (i.e., ions).</p>
<p>5.5.3. The simplest methods to obtain the substance particles</p>
<p>When applying SIS 5.5.1, the simplest way is to destroy the nearest higher „whole” or „excess” (negative ions) level, while when using SIS 5.5.2, the simplest way is to complete combining the nearest lower „non-whole” level.</p>

<p><em><strong>Substance-field analysis</strong> is a part of standard inventive solutions application that models a problem in the form of a substance-field model.</em></p>
<section id="overview-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-1">Overview</h2>
<p>In classical TRIZ, substance-field analysis was used to identify the components (substances and fileds) necessary to model a problem in the form of a Su-Field. However, since cause-effect chain analysis (CECA) became widely used in the analytical phase of projects, this tool has fallen out of common use.</p>
<p>Key disadvantages identified through CECA clearly point to the substances and fields that form the Su-Field of the problem.</p>
<p>Similar to contradictions, the substance-field analysis is used for problem modeling. The tool designed for processing the substance-field models (Su-Fields) of problems is the system of 76 standard inventive solutions (SIS), which leads to solution models represented by selected SISs. In some cases, these solutions can also be presented in the form of Su-Fields. Thus, substance-field analysis is the only TRIZ tool where the model of solution can have the same form as a model the problem.</p>

<p>Basic assumption in the approach is that a minimally functioning system must consist of 3 basic elements:<br>
1. 2 substances (S), i.e., objects with a rest mass involved in the system, and<br>
2. a field (F), i.e., entity without a rest mass that establishes an interaction between substances.</p>
<p>The substances are closely tied to the key problem that needs to be solved. They can refer to microscopic objects, single components, or the entire technical system.&nbsp;The field is typically one of the types selected from the MATChEM model.</p>

<p>Substance-field models (Su-Fields) are inspired by chemistry, specifically the way of representing molecules that reflects their composition and bonds. Similarly, Su-Fields aim to explain relationships and functions in technical systems.</p>
<p>Building substance-field models is performed within substance-field analysis.</p>
<p>Basic assumption in the approach is that a minimally functioning system must consist of 3 basic elements:<br>
1. 2 substances (S), i.e., objects with a rest mass involved in the system, and<br>
2. a field (F), i.e., entity without a rest mass that establishes an interaction between substances.</p>
<p>The substances are closely tied to the key problem that needs to be solved. They can refer to microscopic objects, single components, or the entire technical system.&nbsp;The field is typically one of the types selected from the MATChEM model.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structure-of-a-su-field">Structure of a Su-Field</h2>
<p>Usually, the model is depicted by a diagram where the substances (S) and the field (F) are shown as nodes, and the interaction is presented as connecting lines or arrows.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/su-field_basic.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Symbols of interactions used in Su-Field models are similar to those used in function modeling for devices:</p>

<h1>Contradictions</h1>
<section id="overview-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-3">Overview</h2>
<p>Contradictions are parametric models of key problems identified during problem-identification stage of the project. In modern TRIZ, two types of contradictions are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>engineering (technical) contradiction, and</li>
<li>physical contradiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The engineering contradiction involves two different parameters. It represents a situation where improving one parameter leads to the deterioration of another.</p>
<p>The physical contradiction, on the other hand, pertains to one parameter with two justified but conflicting requirements imposed on it.</p>
</section>
<section id="relation-between-the-engineering-and-physical-contradiction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relation-between-the-engineering-and-physical-contradiction">Relation between the engineering and physical contradiction</h2>
<p>Engineering and physical contradictions are directly related as both are formulated from <strong>IF-THEN-BUT</strong> format.</p>
<ul>
<li>in the engineering contradiction, the improving parameter is placed in the line THEN, while the worsening parameter – in the line BUT;</li>
<li>the physical contradiction concerns the parameter from the line IF, while the contradictory demands can be found in the line THEN.</li>
</ul>
<p>The physical contradiction can be formulated based on the engineering contradiction in the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>formulate an engineering contradiction,</li>
<li>go to the line <strong>IF</strong> of the contradiction; <strong>the parameter/action/property</strong> mentioned in the line IF is the one around which the physical contradiction is formulated,</li>
<li>the line <strong>THEN</strong> of the engineering contradiction is <strong>the justification</strong> of one of the requirements of the physical contradiction;</li>
<li>the line <strong>BUT</strong> can prompt the justification of the other requirement (inverting the statement in the line BUT provides the justification).</li>
</ol>
<p>To formulate the physical contradiction, creating an inverted (alternative) engineering contradiction beforehand can also be very helpful.</p>
<p>The conversion also works in the opposite direction. From each physical contradiction, two engineering contradictions can be derived: the basic and the inverted (alternative) one.</p>

<section id="resolving-the-contradictions" class="level2">

<p>For both types of contradictions, the 40 inventive principles are the recommended models of solutions. However, the ways leading to the specific principles are different:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the engineering contradiction, it is the contradiction matrix, also referred to as Altshuller matrix.</li>
<li>for the physical contradiction, it is the algorithm for resolving physical conradictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aditionally, function-oriented search (FOS), database of scientific effects, and clone problems application can be used for physical contradiction.</p>

<h1>Engineering (technical) contradiction</h1>
<p><em><strong>Engineering contradiction</strong> (EC), also called <strong>technical contradictions</strong> (TC), is a parametric model of the problem in which an attempt to improve one parameter of the engineering system leads to worsening of another parameter.</em></p>
<section id="overview-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-4">Overview</h2>
<p>When solving key problems, methods or technologies are often used that, while improving a specific parameter of a technical system, simultaneously lead to the deterioration of another parameter.</p>
<p>Modeling such a situation as an <strong>engineering contradiction</strong> is the first step toward solving the problem in a way that not only improves the first parameter but also avoids worsening – or even potentially improves – the second parameter as well.</p>
<p>Models of solutions for engineering contradictions are <strong>inventive principles</strong>.&nbsp;The tool that is used to translate the engineering contradiction into inventive principles is <strong>contradiction matrix</strong>&nbsp;also referred to as Althuller matrix.</p>
</section>
<section id="formulating-the-engineering-contradiction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formulating-the-engineering-contradiction">Formulating the engineering contradiction</h2>
<p>An engineering contradiction should be formulated using the <strong>IF-THEN-BUT</strong> format. That formula provides two parameters that&nbsp;constitute the engineering contradiction for solving:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>in the line <strong>THEN</strong>, the parameter that has to be <strong>improved</strong> to resolve the problem,</li>
<li>in the line <strong>BUT</strong>, the parameter that <strong>deteriorates</strong> when the technique / approach mentioned in line IF is applied.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EC_ord-1024x135.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>To properly formulate a contradiction, it is helpful to follow a specific order of providing the information. Typically, we start with the <strong>THEN</strong> position, then proceed to <strong>IF</strong>, and finish with <strong>BUT</strong>. The red numbers in the picture above indicate the order of filling.</p>
<p>Let us consider a simple example of a key problem: <em>the table is not strong enough</em>. One way to strengthen it might be by adding additional reinforcing elements, but these increase its weight. The engineering contradiction will be formulated as follows:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EC_exampl-1024x175.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Usually, a key problem can be modeled using more than one engineering contradiction. This is typically due to the fact that various technologies can traditionally be applied to solve the problem.</p>
<p>For each technology, action, parameter, etc., proposed in the IF row, a separate contradiction should be created.</p>
<p>For example, to solve the problem of a weak table, various approaches can be applied: using a stronger material, increasing the thickness of the tabletop, or shaping it into a slightly domed form. Each of these approaches has its own implications, often leading to the deterioration of another parameter. Therefore, a technical contradiction should be formulated for each approach.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternative-engineering-contradiction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alternative-engineering-contradiction">Alternative engineering contradiction</h2>
<p>For each engineering contradiction, an alternative (opposite or inverted) one can be formulated. The following example presents a procedure for creating it:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/EC_altern-1024x147.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The alternative contradiction should contain the same parameters as the base one, but the problem it models is different. Since the contradiction matrix is not symmetrical, the inverted engineering contradiction supports generating more ideas and can lead to solutions that help to achieve the goal of the project. It is also very helpful in formulating the&nbsp;physical contradiction.</p>

<h1>Contradiction matrix</h1>
<p><em><strong>Contradiction matrix</strong>, also referred to as <strong>Altshuller matrix</strong>, is a matrix that provides a systematic access to the inventive principles for solving engineering contradictions.</em></p>
<section id="overview-5" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-5">Overview</h2>
<p>Contradiction matrix is a&nbsp;problem-solving tool that connects a problem modeled as an engineering contradiction with the statistically most frequently used inventive principles, which are generalized solution models for contradictions.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Alt-matr_model-1024x359.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The traditional Altshuller matrix is a table from which the numbers of inventive principles are read. For user convenience, we have designed an <strong>interactive tool</strong> that significantly simplifies the process. Click the button below to use it.</p>
<p>CONTRADICTION MATRIX</p>
<p>After converting the two specific parameters from the contradiction into the typical parameters, a set of recommended inventive principles can be found in the matrix. Once the set of the inventive principles is identified, brainstorm around them to develop a solution.</p>
<p>Note that the principles listed in a given cell of the matrix are the statistically most frequently used ones, but this does not mean that solutions cannot be found outside of them. Therefore, if the results obtained from the matrix are unsatisfactory, it is worth exploring and considering other principles.</p>
</section>
<section id="structure-of-the-contradiction-matrix" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structure-of-the-contradiction-matrix">Structure of the contradiction matrix</h2>
<p>A traditional contradiction matrix contains 39 typical parameters on both the vertical and the horizontal axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the vertical axis represents a list of parameters that need to be improved to resolve the problem,</li>
<li>the horizontal axis represents a list of parameters that are worsening when we introduce specific technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameters are listed in the same order, both in the rows and in the columns.</p>
<p>On the crossing of the corresponding rows and columns, there are cells containing numbers of recommended inventive principles.</p>
<p>The following picture presents an example:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/contr-matrix-1024x1016.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The boxes in the matrix can contain 4, 3, 2, or 1 principle, some of them are empty.</p>
<p>The order of principles within the cells does not indicate any preferences. All recommended principles are equally important, and their sequence simply reflects the fact that Altshuller added them as he discovered them during his research.</p>
<p>The empty cells in the matrix indicate that no inventive principle has been identified as statistically more frequently used than others. In such cases, any of the 40 principles can be applied equally, without preference.</p>
<p>The contradiction matrix is not symmetrical. Improving parameter A, while parameter B is deteriorating, results in different inventive principles than improving parameter B and deteriorating A.</p>

<h1>Typical parameters</h1>
<p><em><strong>Typical parameters</strong> is a limited set of the pre-defined generalized parameters that typically need improvement in the engineering system, used in the contradiction (Altshuller) matrix.</em></p>
<section id="overview-6" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-6">Overview</h2>
<p>To work with the contradiction matrix, the improving and worsening parameters in an engineering contradiction must be expressed in the form of typical parameters included in the matrix. Due to the diversity of engineering fields, reducing the specific parameters to typical ones is a fundamental aspect of the universality of the Altshuller matrix</p>
<p>Sometimes, a specific parameter may already align with a standard parameter. However, if it does not, conversion is necessary. This applies to both the vertical and horizontal axes of the matrix.</p>
<p>Below, we have provided a complete list of 39 standard parameters, along with examples of specific parameters most commonly associated with them. Keep in mind that the list of specific parameters is not definitive, and each problem should be approached individually.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that our examples are merely suggestions. If you believe your specific parameters can be better expressed using other typical parameters, feel free to do so. This may only increase the number of solution concepts generated.</p>
<p>A good practice is to create several combinations of different standard parameters that fit the formulated contradiction and use the contradiction matrix for each pair. This results in multiple sets of recommendations, each of which should be considered as a potentially best guideline.</p>

<h1>Physical contradiction</h1>
<p><em><strong>Physical contradiction</strong> is a parametric model of the problem that emerges when two justified contradictory demands are placed upon a single parameter of an object to provide the required result.</em></p>
<section id="overview-7" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-7">Overview</h2>
<p>A physical contradiction refers to a situation where a single parameter of an object is subjected to two conflicting requirements. The focus on a single parameter distinguishes it from an engineering contradiction (which involves two different parameters). However, both types of contradictions are directly interconnected and can be derived from one another.</p>
<p>Note that if one of the required parameter states cannot be justified, then there is no physical contradiction, rather you have a solution.</p>
<p>The physical contradiction is more precise than the engineering contradiction because the problem is modeled using a parameter belonging to only one component. This makes it clear from the outset which component should be addressed with the recommendations derived from TRIZ.</p>
<p>Models of solutions for the physical contradictions are <strong>inventive principles</strong>. The tool that is used to translate the engineering contradiction into inventive principles is the&nbsp;<strong>algorithm for resolving physical conradictions</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-8">Overview</h2>
<p>Several problem-solving tools can be used to solve physical contradictions; however, the algorithm is the most commonly applied. The choice of a specific approach leads to a corresponding set of inventive principles. These are the same inventive principles included in the contradiction matrix but grouped differently.</p>
<p>Once the appropriate set of inventive principles for a given contradiction is identified, a brainstorming session is conducted around them to propose specific solutions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approaches-of-resolving-physical-contradictions">Approaches of resolving physical contradictions</h2>
<p>The key approach to solving physical contradictions involves <strong>separating</strong> the conflicting requirements in space, time, relation, or direction. To achieve this, appropriate control questions are asked. This helps filter the methods for separating conflicting demands that are applicable in the given case. Separation at the system level is a slightly different approach. It is the only method that does not require asking any control questions and is recommended in each case.</p>
<p>If separating the conflicting requirements is not possible, <strong>satisfying</strong> both demands should be explored.</p>
<p>The final approach is to resolve the problem by completely <strong>bypassing</strong> the contradictory demands.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PC_algorythm-1024x901.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Separating and satisfying contradictory demands lead to specific sets of inventive principles; for bypassing any principle can be applied.</p>
<p>Problems should be modeled in multiple ways. The more problem models are created, the more solution models are generated, which in turn leads to a greater number of ideas.</p>
<p>Each specific physical contradiction represents a unique situation. In some cases, all approaches may work, while in others, only a few – or even just one – may be applicable.&nbsp;If conflicting requirements can be separated in different ways, it is worth exploring all possible variants. Even if separation yields good ideas, it is recommended to also consider satisfying and bypassing approaches.</p>

<p>Bypassing contradictory demands is the least used method of resolving physical contradictions. It is usually used when separating or satisfying contradictory demands doesn’t work.</p>
<p>The approach is based on changing the engineering system so that the physical contradiction becomes irrelevant and does not need to be resolved anymore, e.g.&nbsp;finding different ways of performing the desired function.</p>
<p>There are <strong>no inventive principles</strong> assigned to this method, which means that all principles can be applied.</p>

<h1>Inventive principle</h1>
<p><em><strong>Inventive principle</strong>&nbsp;is an abstract model of a solution that provides generalized recommendations for modifying the system to solve the problem formulated as the contradiction.</em></p>
<section id="overview-9" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-9">Overview</h2>
<p>The inventive principles are proposed <strong>models of solutions</strong> for both engineering contradictions and physical contradictions. Depending on the type of contradiction, and thus the tool used to process it, a different set of principles will be proposed to solve the problem. In other words, the contradiction matrix will lead to different solution models than the algorithm for resolving physical contradictions.</p>
<p>The concept of inventive principles originated from G. Altshuller’s extensive research into patents across various engineering fields. By focusing on patents that resolved contradictions rather than those aimed at optimization, Altshuller identified patterns among innovative solutions. Through systematic analysis and classification of thousands of patents, he discovered that problems modeled as similar engineering contradictions often shared conceptually similar solutions. These generalized approaches were distilled and formalized into 40 inventive principles.</p>

<h1>ARIZ</h1>
<p><em><strong>ARIZ</strong> is&nbsp;a problem-solving tool that transforms a complex key problem into a well-defined model of the problem, which can be solved effectively using a wide spectrum of TRIZ tools.</em></p>
<section id="overview-10" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-10">Overview</h2>
<p>ARIZ is a Russian acronym of <strong>algorithm for inventive problem solving</strong> (<em>алгоритм решения изобретательских задач</em>, <em>АРИЗ</em>).</p>
<p>There have been several versions of ARIZ over the years. The last one officially published under Altshuller’s name is ARIZ-85C. Although later versions were developed posthumously, they did not significantly improve the procedure’s effectiveness – some even added unnecessary complexity. As a result, ARIZ-85C remains the official version.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that in 1985, TRIZ did not yet include the advanced analytical tools available today. Still, Altshuller clearly understood the importance of identifying the right problem to solve, which is why ARIZ-85C already includes several built-in analytical procedures.</p>

<p>The strength of ARIZ is determined by its distinctive features:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="focusing-on-achieving-the-ideal-final-result">Focusing on achieving the ideal final result</h3>
<p>ARIZ is focused on achieving the ideal final result (IFR) – the best possible solution to a problem, in which the problem is completely eliminated with minimal changes to the system and no deterioration of its parameters.</p>
<p>It’s important not to confuse the concept of IFR with that of the ideal system, as the two are fundamentally different – though often mistakenly used interchangeably.&nbsp;While the ideal system refers to a system that does not exist (it performs the function without taking up space, costing anything, or requiring maintenance), the IFR in ARIZ is about <strong>solving a specific problem</strong> within an existing system by making only minimal adjustments. The system still exists, takes up space, generates costs, and requires upkeep – but the problem it had is resolved in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<section id="basing-on-trends-of-engineering-system-evolution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basing-on-trends-of-engineering-system-evolution">Basing on trends of engineering system evolution</h3>
<p>Like many other TRIZ tools, ARIZ is built on the trends of engineering system evolution. The algorithm includes steps that directly reflect various trends – such as identifying and eliminating contradictions, aiming for the ideal final result (IFR), focusing on minimal changes to the initial system, or applying the multi-screen approach.</p>
<p>All of these actions are designed to help overcome psychological inertia and lead to the most effective possible solution.</p>
</section>
<section id="focusing-on-the-system-resources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="focusing-on-the-system-resources">Focusing on the system resources</h3>
<p>Making minimal changes to the system means working with resources that are already present within the system and its supersystem. While it might be tempting to introduce new materials, add components, or apply new fields, such changes often come with significant costs. In reality, most systems already contain what’s needed to solve the problem – those resources are simply overlooked. One of ARIZ’s key goals is to uncover them.</p>
<p>To do this, ARIZ works in two directions. First, it narrows focus like a funnel, transforming a broad key problem into a well-defined TRIZ mini-problem. Then, it expands outward, revealing more and more resources hidden within the system and supersystem as the analysis progresses.</p>

<section id="part-1.-analyze-the-system" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-1.-analyze-the-system">Part 1. Analyze the system</h2>
<p>In general, part 1 is about the analysis of the key problem. It includes seven steps.</p>
<p>It begins with identifying main function of the system, as wel as components of the system and its supersystem. After that the engineering problem is modelled as two alternative (inverted) engineering contradictions and the mini-problem is formulated.<br>
The next steps help determine the tool(s) and the product(s) in the analyzed conflict. The two states of them are also identified. Next, graphical models of the contradictions are created. Finally, the base contradiction is selected, intensified, and the problem is formulated.</p>
<section id="step-1.1.-formulate-the-mini-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1.1.-formulate-the-mini-problem">Step 1.1. Formulate the mini-problem</h3>
<p>The first step of ARIZ is to define the mini-problem by identifying the system and modeling the problem as engineering contradictions&nbsp;(EC).</p>
<p>In ARIZ, the system may differ from the one analyzed earlier during function analysis. Here, the focus is on the key problem, so the system includes only components directly related to it. However, it is recommended that not only technological components of the system be listed but also the “natural” ones that interact with it. For example, in the problem of protecting a telescope antenna, natural objects like lightning or incoming radio waves (emitted by celestial bodies) should also be considered.</p>
<p>The key disadvantages, identified earlier through CECA, help pinpoint the root causes, which may lie deep within or outside the original system. Eliminating these root causes defines the key problem, and the <em>system</em> in ARIZ refers to the area where this problem occurs.</p>
<p>To define the system, its main function is specified, and essential components of both the system and supersystem are listed. Based on this, two types of engineering contradictions are formulated: EC-1 (direct) and EC-2 (inverted). Together, they form the foundation of the mini-problem.</p>
<p>When formulating contradictions, make sure to include key parameters in the <em>IF</em>, <em>THEN</em>, and <em>BUT</em> lines. It’s also helpful to keep the function format in the <em>THEN</em> and <em>BUT</em> lines, showing how the function carrier affects a specific parameter of the function object. This clarity will support later steps in the process.</p>
<p>Sometimes the problem situation involves only the product – the tool is absent. In such cases, there is no clear technical contradiction, but one can still be formulated by considering two states of the product, even if one of those states seems impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>For example – <em>how can we observe tiny particles suspended in a transparent liquid with the naked eye, if the particles are so small that light flows around them?</em></p>
<p>TC-1: <em>The liquid remains transparent because the particles are small, but they cannot be seen with the naked eye</em>.</p>
<p>TC-2: <em>Larger particles are easier to observe, but they make the liquid no longer transparent, which is an unacceptable outcome</em>.</p>
<p>Since we cannot change the product, we will proceed only with TC-1, but we also note that TC-2 adds a requirement to the product:&nbsp;<em>The particles must remain small (to keep the liquid transparent) and simultaneously become large (so they can be seen)</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-1.2.-determine-the-conflicting-pair" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1.2.-determine-the-conflicting-pair">Step 1.2. Determine the conflicting pair</h3>
<p>Step 1.2 is used to identify the tool(s) and product(s) that form the conflicting pair.</p>
<p>In this step, we also identify the states in which the tool operates. These states refer to the properties, features, or parameters specified in the <em>IF</em> line of the contradictions formulated in step 1.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>state 1 can be found in the direct contradiction,</li>
<li>state 2 appears in the inverted&nbsp; contradiction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1.3.-create-graphical-models-of-the-engineering-contradictions">Step 1.3. Create graphical models of the engineering contradictions</h3>
<p>In Step 1.3, the problem is presented in graphic form. Graphs are created for both EC-1 and EC-2.</p>
<p>The graphs are built using symbols familiar from tools such as function analysis and substance-field modeling.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the purpose of the diagrams is not to depict functions, but to illustrate engineering contradictions.</p>
<p>The diagram must clearly show both the useful and the harmful action. In practice, this means there should be two arrows – one “good” and one “bad.” If both arrows represent the same type of effect (e.g.&nbsp;both are useful, or both are harmful/insufficient/excessive), it indicates a mistake that needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>The conflicting pair shown in the illustration typically consists of two components, but in some cases it may involve three – either two products and one tool, or one product and two tools.</p>

<section id="step-1.4.-select-a-contradiction-for-further-analysis-basic-contradiction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1.4.-select-a-contradiction-for-further-analysis-basic-contradiction">Step 1.4. Select a contradiction for further analysis (basic contradiction)</h3>
<p>EC-1 and EC-2 model the same situation, but they represent completely different problems.</p>
<p>To achieve the project goal, both problems need to be addressed, but it’s not possible to deal with them simultaneously. At this stage, we must choose which engineering contradiction to focus on – this becomes the basic contradiction.</p>
<p>Altshuller recommended selecting the contradiction in which the system’s main function is performed. This approach is quite natural, as the goal is to solve the problem with minimal changes to the system. However, experience shows that there are cases where engineers are open to more significant modifications. In such situations, choosing the inverted contradiction may be the better option.</p>
<p>Importantly, selecting one contradiction at this point does not mean discarding the other one. If the solutions developed in the next steps are not satisfactory, the algorithm itself will prompt a return to this step and suggest reconsidering the second contradiction.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-1.5.-intensify-the-conflict" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1.5.-intensify-the-conflict">Step 1.5. Intensify the conflict</h3>
<p>This step has been introduced to help overcome psychological inertia, including the natural tendency of engineers to focus on optimization. While optimization isn’t inherently bad, it is not desirable during the conceptual phase of TRIZ-based projects.</p>
<p>To intensify the contradiction, the parameter from the line <em>IF</em> is pushed to its absolute extreme. If something was supposed to be light, it should now weigh nothing; if it was supposed to be small, it should now cease to exist entirely.</p>
<p>Strengthening this parameter will require corresponding adjustments to the <em>THEN</em> and <em>BUT</em> positions in the contradiction model.</p>
<p><strong>Important!</strong> From this point onward, we will be working exclusively with the intensified contradiction in ARIZ.</p>

<p>The entire analysis conducted in Part 1, along with the construction of the problem model, results in a significant refinement of the problem.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-2.-analyzing-the-problem-model">Part 2. Analyzing the problem model</h2>
<p>Part 2 of ARIZ focuses on analyzing the resources available within the system and its supersystem.</p>
<p>ARIZ is designed for projects that allow only minimal changes to the system. This usually rules out the introduction of new resources, which makes identifying existing resources absolutely critical.</p>
<p>Part 2 consists of three steps, during which we identify the main types of resources considered in ARIZ:</p>
<ul>
<li>space resources,</li>
<li>time resources, and</li>
<li>substance and field resources of the system and its supersystem, including their parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2.1.-define-the-operating-zone">Step 2.1. Define the operating zone</h3>
<p>In Step 2.1, the spatial resources of the system are identified. The operating zone (also called operating space) refers to the area where the conflict identified in the problem model occurs.</p>
<p>According to the previously formulated contradiction, the system faces two opposing requirements. One must be fulfilled in operating zone 1 (OZ-1), the other in operating zone 2 (OZ-2).&nbsp;If these zones are separated, the contradiction may be resolved by separating the contradictory demands in space. If the zones overlap, then other methods must be explored to resolve the contradiction.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-2.2.-define-the-operating-time" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2.2.-define-the-operating-time">Step 2.2. Define the operating time</h3>
<p>In this step, the time resources of the system are identified.</p>
<p>The operating time is most simply defined as the time in which the conflict identified in the problem model occurs.&nbsp;According to the contradiction, the system faces two opposing requirements. <strong>Operating time 1</strong> (OT-1) is the period during which the first requirement of the system is met, while <strong>operating time 2</strong> (OT-2) is the period during which the second requirement occurs.</p>
<p>It is essential to determine whether these zones are separated or overlapping. If these times are different, the contradiction can be resolved by separating the contradictory requirements in time. If the times overlap, the separation is not possible hence a different strategy is required.</p>

<section id="step-2.3.-define-the-substance-field-resources-sfr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2.3.-define-the-substance-field-resources-sfr">Step 2.3. Define the substance-field resources (SFR)</h3>
<p>In the final step of Part 2, the focus shifts to the analysis of substance and field resources – both those already present and those that can be easily accessed or introduced.</p>
<p>The resources under consideration include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>internal resources:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>product resources, and</li>
<li>tool resources,</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>external resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>During resource analysis, we are interested not only in the presence of a substance or field. Special attention is given to their <strong>parameters</strong> or <strong>features</strong>, which are considered particularly valuable in ARIZ. When creating a list of resources, everything that comes to your mind should be included, as any resource could be a potential candidate for solving the problem.</p>
<p>The <strong>internal resources</strong> of the conflicting pair are the first to be analyzed. Since both the tool and the product are already located in the conflict zone, their associated resources are also present – no additional effort is required to deliver them.</p>
<p>Compared to the tool, the product’s resources may be more limited in terms of availability. While we often have the freedom to modify the tool as needed, making changes to the product may be subject to design, functional, or business constraints.</p>
<p>When it comes to <strong>external resources</strong>, the search begins in the immediate surroundings of the conflict – the operating zone.&nbsp;However, it is beneficial to expand the search area, as there may be low-cost or even free resources available in the supersystem. Nearly every engineering project has access to universal resources like air and gravity. Additionally, nearby systems may generate waste or possess surplus materials or fields that could be valuable for solving the problem.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-3.-defining-the-ideal-final-result-and-formulating-the-physical-contradiction">Part 3. Defining the ideal final result and formulating the physical contradiction</h2>
<p>Part 3 of ARIZ focuses on the ideal final result (IFR) and identifying physical contradictions that hinder achieving it.</p>
<section id="step-3.1.-formulate-ifr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3.1.-formulate-ifr">Step 3.1. Formulate IFR</h3>
<p>In Step 3.1, we return to the requirements defined for the X-factor based on the intensified technical contradiction from Step 1.6. Now, we can supplement these requirements with those identified in Steps 2.1 and 2.2, relating to the operating zone and operating time.</p>
<p>To formulate the ideal final result (IFR), a template is typically used. However, in some projects, applying the template word-for-word may result in a confusing or unclear statement. In such cases, it’s recommended to break the text into several separate sentences to clearly and effectively convey the intended meaning.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3.2.-formulate-the-intensified-ideal-final-result" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3.2.-formulate-the-intensified-ideal-final-result">Step 3.2. Formulate the intensified ideal final result</h3>
<p>At this stage, the X-factor from Step 3.1 is replaced with a specific available resource.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the only resources that may be used to replace the X-factor are those identified in Step 2.3 – using any other resources is not in line with ARIZ. However, the replacement can be a single resource or a combination of several.</p>
<p>It is recommended to consider SFRs in the following order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SFR of the tool,</li>
<li>SFR of the supersystem,</li>
<li>other external SFR,</li>
<li>SFR of the product (if not restricted).</li>
</ol>
<p>Modifications to the product are usually significantly restricted or even completely prohibited. However, there are rare situations where the product may be allowed to change on its own, change temporarily, or be combined with a void, etc.&nbsp;SFR of the product may be considered only if such modifications are explicitly permitted.</p>
<p>The list of resources identified in Part 2 is usually quite long. Considering each one as a potential X-factor would significantly extend the project timeline.&nbsp;That’s why in Step 3.2, it is recommended to start by considering 5 to 6 selected resources. If using them does not lead to satisfactory results, you can return to Step 3.2 later in the ARIZ process to explore other resources.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3.3.-define-the-physical-contradiction-on-macro-level" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3.3.-define-the-physical-contradiction-on-macro-level">Step 3.3. Define the physical contradiction on macro-level</h3>
<p>The intensified ideal final result (IFR) concepts developed in Step 3.2 usually do not yet solve the mini-problem. It is highly likely that the chosen resources are prevented from acting effectively as X-factors due to underlying physical contradictions. Identifying these contradictions enables us to attempt to resolve them.</p>
<p>For formulating the physical contradictions here, we usually use the following pattern:</p>
<p><em><strong>The parameter</strong> [specify] <strong>of the resource</strong> [specify] <strong>should be value 1</strong> [specify] <strong>to eliminate the harmful action</strong> [specify] <strong>and/or value 2</strong> [specify] <strong>to provide the useful function</strong> [specify].</em></p>
<p>When approaching the formulation of physical contradictions, we typically encounter one of the following three scenarios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The contradiction can be clearly formulated and processed.</li>
<li>After formulating the contradiction, it turns out that the selected resource has no influence or connection to the parameters that need to be changed. At this stage, the resource is set aside – it may be reconsidered later in the ARIZ process.</li>
<li>It becomes clear that only one demand of the contradiction is justified. This means the contradiction does not actually exist – and we’ve just found the solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>The physical contradictions formulated in Step 3.2 represent models of entirely new problems that had not been previously identified – yet they are precisely what gives ARIZ its distinctive power.</p>

<h1>Conflicting pair</h1>
<p><em><strong>Conflicting pair</strong> is a pair of components, the tool(s) and the product(s), interaction between which causes a conflict that prevents reaching the required result.</em></p>
<section id="overview-11" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-11">Overview</h2>
<p>Conflicting pair is a term used in ARIZ.</p>
<p>The terms of the tool and the product are specific to ARIZ but closely mirror the function carrier and function object from function analysis. The product corresponds to the target component – the object of the system’s main function – while the tool is the component that performs this function. This analogy makes it easier to quickly identify the conflicting pair in the system.</p>
<p>A conflicting pair consists of <strong>two or three components</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, in the process of sealing glass ampoules containing medicine, <em>the flame</em>, <em>the ampoule</em>, and <em>the medicine</em> form a conflicting pair. The flame melts the ampoule tip, but if it’s too strong, it damages the medicine; if it’s too weak, it fails to seal the ampoule properly. In this case, the pair includes one tool (the flame) and two products (the ampoule and the medicine).&nbsp;In other scenarios, a conflicting pair may involve two tools and one product.</p>

<section id="overview-12" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-12">Overview</h2>
<p>Mini-problem is a concept used in ARIZ.</p>
<p>The prefix “mini” does not imply that the problem is small, but rather that its solution must involve only <strong>minimal changes to the system</strong>.</p>
<p>A mini-problem is created by taking the original problem situation and adding a constraint: everything in the system must stay the same or become simpler, while the desired action (or property) appears, or the harmful action (or property) disappears. This transformation doesn’t mean we’re trying to solve a “smaller” problem. Instead, adding this extra requirement – achieving the desired result without changing the system – sharpens the conflict and blocks any path toward compromise right from the start. This is achieved by making use of resources that already exist – either within the system or in its surrounding environment.</p>
<p>In engineering projects, this approach is often a necessary condition for balancing business interests with the ambitions of engineers.</p>
<p>The mini-problems a key problems that can arise from different sources, like CECA, trimming, or feature transfer.</p>

<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ARIZ_OpTime-1024x175.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>If these times are different, the contradiction can be resolved by separating the contradictory requirements in time. If the times overlap, the separation is not possible hence a different strategy is required.</p>
<p>Creating sketches that clearly highlight OT-1 and OT-2 is recommended. In fact, Altshuller considered such sketches mandatory during this step.</p>
<p>Altshuller recommended a deeper time analysis by examining three distinct phases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>before the conflict,</li>
<li>during the conflict, and</li>
<li>after the conflict.</li>
</ol>
<p>Analysing the first phase enables the implementation of preventive measures ahead of time.&nbsp;Analysing the third phase allows for actions aimed at eliminating the consequences of the conflict.</p>
<p>Although in some projects the before and/or after phases may not be applicable, considering this structure can help identify a broader range of time-related resources, often leading to more effective and robust solutions.</p>
