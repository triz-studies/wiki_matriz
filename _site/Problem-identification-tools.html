<h1>Problem-identification tools</h1>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/3stages_pr-id-1024x76.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The goal of the first stage of the project is to analyze the engineering system and identify the “right” problems to solve. These are deep, hidden issues that represent the root causes rather than the symptoms and are typically not obvious at the beginning.</p>
<p>The outcome of the whole analytical block is a list of key problems that have to be solved during the problem-solving stage to achieve the goal of the project.</p>
<p>According to MATRIZ methodology, the problem-identification toolbox consists of the following tools:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>fuction-cost analysis,</li>
<li>flow analysis,</li>
<li>cause-effect chain analysis (CECA),</li>
<li>trimming,</li>
<li>feature transfer,</li>
<li>S-curve analysis, and</li>
<li>trends of engineering system evolution (TESE) analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>A tool that is also used at this stage of the project is innovative benchmarking.</p>
<p>The selection of tools and the order in which they are used should always be tailored to the project’s goal. Projects aimed at developing a new, patentable solution may be conducted differently than those focused on improving an existing system.</p>

<h1>Function-cost analysis</h1>
<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The term of function-cost analysis is sometimes used as a synonym for function analysis. Technically, it should be considered as function analysis supplemented with cost analysis&nbsp;performed in its final stage.</p>
<p>The analysis is usually performed if cost reduction is a goal of the project. It helps identify function disadvantages and cost disadvantages that are later used as building blocks for CECA. It also aids in making decisions about which components should be considered for trimming.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/F-C-an-768x432.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Function-cost analysis is usually presented by adding a column to the&nbsp;function model table. If the project involves developing an innovation strategy, its results can also be illustrated in the form of a function-cost diagram.</p>
<p>The tool should not be confused with value analysis. Value analysis involves mathematically calculating value of components based on the function-cost diagram illustrating results of function-cost analysis.</p>

<h1>Function analysis</h1>
<p><em><strong>Function analysis</strong> is an analytical tool that identifies functions, their characteristics, and the cost of the system and its supersystem components.</em></p>
<section id="overview-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-1">Overview</h2>
<p>Every engineering system is designed to deliver specific main function(s). This functionality is the result of functions performed by individual components of the engineering system. Function analysis involves identifying and characterizing these functions, making it the foundation for almost all problem-identification&nbsp;and&nbsp;problem-solving&nbsp;tools used in&nbsp;TRIZ.</p>
<p>The outcomes of the tool are:</p>
<ul>
<li>function model of the system,</li>
<li>a list of function disadvantages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Function analysis neither provides new information about the analyzed system, nor suggests solutions but is crucial for project success. It organizes and translates information&nbsp;about the&nbsp;system into&nbsp;the language of functions, enabling the effective application of problem-solving tools.</p>
<p>Function analysis, supplemented with cost analysis, helps formulate a system development strategy. It aids in determining which component(s) should be trimmed, which should be improved, and which should remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The function analysis of devices consists of three stages:</p>

<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FA-for-D_stages-1024x76.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>At each stage, information is gathered to confirm one of the three conditions for a function to occur. First, a list of components is created, as both the function carrier and the function object must be components of the system or its supersystem. Then, pairs of components with any interactions are identified. Finally, for each pair, it is determined whether one component in the pairs alters or intentionally maintains any parameter of the other.</p>

<section id="overview-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-3">Overview</h3>
<p>Function analysis of processes is applied to technical systems, in which the set of components changes as the time goes, i.e.&nbsp;some of them appear, while others disappear from the system.</p>
<p>It is a fairly universal analytical tool. In the MATRIZ methodology, it was developed to deal with technological processes. However, with appropriate modifications, it can be applied to any processes that can be presented as step-by-step procedures, such as administrative, managerial, or logistical processes, among others.</p>
</section>
<section id="stages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stages">Stages</h3>
<p>Function analysis of the process consist of two stages:</p>
<ol type="1">

</ol>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FA_pr_stages-1024x122.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>No that, on the contrary to devices, interaction analysis is not conducted for processes. In TRIZ, interaction is understood as physical contact, and since no physical contact occurs between the components of processes (operations), there are no interactions to analyze.</p>
<p>The first step in process analysis involves identifying all the relevant components of the system. However, the concept of components differs – they are no longer substances and/or fields but the operations that constitute the process. Additionally, neither the target component nor supersystem components are used here. Technically, they exist, however, essentially are not actively used.</p>
<p>The second and final step of function analysis for processes is function modeling. Due to the specific nature of the system, functions are no longer identified between components but <strong>within the components</strong> themselves, which in this case are the operations.</p>

<h1>Component analysis</h1>
<p><em><strong>Component analysis</strong> is a stage in function analysis that identifies components of the engineering system and its supersystem.</em></p>
<section id="overview-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-4">Overview</h2>
<p>Component analysis is the starting point of the function analysis, both for devices and processes.&nbsp;Its goal is to identify all components of the engineering system and relevant components of its supersystem.</p>
<p>The output of the analysis is a component model, which serves as input for interaction analysis when analyzing a device, and for function modeling when analyzing a process.</p>
</section>
<section id="defining-the-system-boundaries" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-the-system-boundaries">Defining the system boundaries</h2>
<p>Before proceeding to the component analysis, it is essential to define boundaries of the system. They are crucial during function modeling stage as they significantly influence function ranking.</p>
<p>For devices, boundaries between the system and its supersystem are necessary to determine the status of components, i.e.&nbsp;to&nbsp;determine which components belong to the system and which of them belong to its supersystem. Additionally, main function of the system can only be identified once the boundaries are defined – as the boundaries change, the main function may also change, along with the target component.</p>
<p>In processes, supersystem components do not play an active role in the function analysis; however, how we define the boundaries can still have a direct impact on ranks of functions.</p>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="recommendations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>The choice of the hierarchy level depends on the goal and constraints of the project. The analysis should be conducted at the level where components are directly linked to the problem. In some cases, these components may need to be broken down into smaller parts for clarity.</p>
<p>For the supersystem components, select only those that are relevant to the project, but don’t overlook those that may provide resources that can be used to improve the system, including<em>air</em> or <em>gravity</em>.</p>
<p>When performing component analysis for devices, the system’s specifications can be very helpful; however, the level of detail can be adjusted as needed.&nbsp;Components sourced from external suppliers, where there is no control over the design or redesign is not permitted, sould be included as a single assembly without detailed analysis.</p>

</section>
<section id="component-analysis-for-processes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="component-analysis-for-processes">Component analysis for processes</h2>
<p>In the function analysis of the process, the component analysis is a phase when the process is split into operations that are its components.</p>
<p>The operations in the process are usually carried out sequentially:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FA_ca-proc_seq-1024x63.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>They may also be performed in parallel:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FA_ca-proc_par-1024x165.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Regardless of whether the operations are carried out in parallel or sequentially, it may happen that they will create a loop:</p>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="recommendations-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommendations-1">Recommendations</h3>
<p>Similarly to devices, in the analysis of processes, the decision on the level of detail in the breakdown depends on us and should be based on the project’s goal. The system can be divided into large operations or a greater number of smaller ones.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that having operations with only one function is not practical. On the other hand, if an operation contains too many functions, it may significantly complicate trimming.</p>
<p>Existing process documentation, such as standard operating procedures (SOPs), process flow diagrams, equipment specifications, or transformation flowsheets, can be a very useful source of data for component analysis. Interviews with employees who operate, maintain, or supervise the process can also provide valuable insights.&nbsp;Finally, it’s worth spending some time on the production floor, observing the process in action, analyzing historical process data, and so on. This hands-on approach may reveal discrepancies compared to the documentation.</p>

<section id="field-in-triz" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="field-in-triz">Field in TRIZ</h4>
<p>In TRIZ, the concept of a field extends beyond the traditional scientific definition and includes any interaction between system components, not just classical fields like gravity and electromagnetism. The term <em>field</em> is used from a technical perspective to facilitate idea generation. Fields represent various interactions that can occur between substances in a system.</p>
<p>Categorizing fields according to their types has led to the development of MATChEM that is an acronym representing six types of fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mechanical</strong>: interactions that are perceived as mechanical energy, e.g.&nbsp;gravity, friction, centrifugal force, vibrations, etc.</li>
<li><strong>acoustic</strong>: sound interactions like audible sound, ultrasound, seismic waves, resonance, etc.</li>
<li><strong>thermal</strong>: temperature related interactions, e.g.&nbsp;heating, cooling, phase changes, etc.</li>
<li><strong>chemical</strong>: interactions and reactions like oxidation, polymerization, synthesizing, as well as using catalysts or inhibitors, etc.</li>
<li><strong>electrical</strong>: phenomena based on electricity, e.g.&nbsp;Foucault currents, electrostatic charges, ionization, piezoelectric effects, etc.</li>
<li><strong>magnetic</strong>: mostly magnetic fields.</li>

<h1>Engineering system</h1>
<p><em><strong>Engineering (technical) system</strong> is a system that has been developed to perform a function.</em></p>
<section id="overview-6" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-6">Overview</h2>
<p><em>Engineering system</em> and <em>technical system</em> are the terms used interchangeably in TRIZ.</p>
<p>The function for which the system is designed is called main function. A system that doesn’t perform any main function cannot exist, but there are many systems performing several main functions.</p>
<p>Defining boundaries of the engineering system is a crucial step in any project.&nbsp;The boundaries are determined by the <strong>project goal</strong> and <strong>project constraints</strong>. They depend on what is necessary and possible to change and stay within the project budget and other specifics.&nbsp;Everything beyond the boundaries, including the environmental surrounding, is called a supersystem.</p>
<p>Defining the system boundaries of the system is important because:</p>
<ul>
<li>main function of the system can only be identified once the boundaries are defined – as the boundaries change, the main function may also change, along with the target component;</li>
<li>it determines which components belong to the system and which of them belong to its supersystem;</li>
<li>the function rank depends on the main function – since the boundaries of the engineering system are determined by the project goal and project constraints, they may depend on what part of the device is within the scope of the project (what is allowed to redesign, what changes are covered by the project budget, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical systems can also include subsystems or components created by nature, both organic (plants, animals, or humans) and inorganic (minerals, water, etc.).</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the interaction analysis is to identify whether interactions exist between components within the component model. At this stage, the consequences of the&nbsp;identified&nbsp;interactions are not considered; the focus is solely on their presence.</p>
<p>Note that the interaction analysis is a stage of function analysis that is performed <strong>only for devices</strong>. In function analysis of processes this step is entirely skipped because there are no interactions between components.</p>
</section>
<section id="procedure-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure-2">Procedure</h2>
<p>To facilitate the interaction analysis, the previously developed component model is utilized. The analysis is typically conducted by creating an interaction matrix, which is the output.</p>
<p>The matrix is created according to the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>create the matrix template with the number of columns and rows corresponding to the number of all identified components,</li>
<li>fill out the matrix template with the names of components in column and the raw headings, in the same order,</li>
<li>check if there is any interaction for each pair of components in the matrix; record the results of your analysis – with a “+” sign if the interaction exists, a “–” when it does not,</li>
<li>check if the interaction matrix is symmetrical relative to the diagonal running from the upper left-hand corner to the lower right-hand corner.</li>

<h1>Interaction</h1>
<p><em><strong>Interaction</strong> is a physical touch between components of the engineeging system and/or components of its supersystem.</em></p>
<section id="overview-10" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-10">Overview</h2>
<p>Interaction is one of key terms in function analysis for devices&nbsp;(not applied for processes) as the a&nbsp;fundamental principle is that for any function to exist between two components, there must be an interaction (physical touch) between them.</p>
<p>The occurrence of interactions depends directly on how components are defined. Identifying interactions between components that are substances is usually straightforward – they occur when these components come into direct contact, even at a single point.</p>
<p>If a component is a field, such as an electromagnetic field (<em>light</em>), there is a physical interaction between the field and its emitter (e.g., <em>a light bulb</em>) as well as between the field and its receiver (e.g., <em>a watching person</em>). However, in this case, the emitter (<em>the light bulb</em>) and receiver (<em>the person</em>) do not interact directly with each other.</p>
<p>If a component is defined as a combination of a substance and a field (e.g., <em>a light bulb along with the electromagnetic field it emits</em>), then an interaction with the receiver does exist (<em>the light bulb</em> “touches” <em>the person</em> through <em>the light</em>).</p>
<p>Interactions between components are identified during interaction analysis, which is the second stage of function analysis for devices. They are recorded in the form of an interaction matrix, which then serves as the input for function modeling, the final stage of the analysis.</p>

<h1>Interaction matrix</h1>
<p><em><strong>Interaction matrix</strong> is a table showing interactions among components of the analyzed engineering system and its supersystem. It is a result of the interaction analysis.</em></p>
<section id="overview-11" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-11">Overview</h2>
<p>The interaction matrix is an output of the interaction analysis conducted during the function analysis of a device. It is typically presented in the form of a table, where the input data are the components identified during the component analysis. Accurate completing this matrix is crucial for conducting the next stage of the function analysis, which is function modeling.</p>
</section>
<section id="creating-the-interaction-matrix" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-the-interaction-matrix">Creating the interaction matrix</h2>
<p>The interaction matrix is created based on the component model. To build it, follow the steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Construct a matrix with rows and columns equal to the number of all components identified during the component analysis.</li>
<li>Place the names of the components in both the column headers and row headings in the same sequence. It is&nbsp; recommended that the components be entered in the following order:
<ul>
<li>the target component(s) of the system,</li>
<li>the system components,</li>
<li>the supersystem components.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the matrix, record the presence of an interaction with a “+” sign and the absence with a “–” sign.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FA_int-matrix-1024x284.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The interaction matrix <strong>must be symmetrical</strong> relative to the diagonal that runs from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. If <em>component 1</em> interacts with <em>component 2</em>, then <em>2</em> must also interact with <em>1</em>. This symmetry arises because the matrix uses the same set of components in both its rows and columns in the same order, making any interaction mutual.</p>
<p>When constructing the interaction matrix, it’s important to accurately assess the presence of interactions between components. Mislabeling these interactions can affect the outcome of the whole function analysis.</p>
<p>If a non-existent interaction is mistakenly marked with an “+,” the analysis process may take longer as it will be examined for potential functions later. However, failing to mark an actual interaction has more serious consequences, as it can result in missing functions, leading to incomplete analysis and possibly incorrect conclusions. In cases of uncertainty, it is advisable to use a “+” to ensure all potential interactions are considered.</p>

<p>Function modeling is the final stage of function analysis for both devices and processes. This stage involves creating a function model in the form of a table, a graph, or both.</p>
<p>If cost reduction is the goal of the project, function modeling is supplemented with cost analysis, which&nbsp;provides important information about the components.

<p>Function modeling is the stage of function analysis where the two types of analysis differ the most.</p>
<section id="input" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="input">Input</h3>
<p>The input to function modeling for devices is the interaction matrix, specifically the boxes with the sign “+”. Since interaction is a basic condition for the function to exist, only those pairs of components between which it exists are considered, while all the cells assigned with “–“ are being ignored.<br>
For each cell containing „+” sign, an analysis is performed to investigate if the interaction between components represents a function. The components in the vertical axis are treated as function carriers and the components in the horizontal axis as function objects.</p>
<p>Since the interaction analysis for processes is not performed at all, the input to function modeling is a component model created during the component analysis.</p>

<p>Function in TRIZ plays a particularly crucial role. One of the main paradigms of the methodology is separating the function from its carrier.

<section id="conditions-for-a-function-existence" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conditions-for-a-function-existence">Conditions for a function existence</h2>
<p>For a function to be considered as performed, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>both the function carrier and the object of the function are substances and/or fields,</li>
<li>the function carrier interacts with the object of the function, and</li>
<li>the action performed by the function carrier changes or maintains (keeps unchanged) some parameter of the object; if such a parameter cannot be identified, it means that there is no function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that one function <strong>can change only one parameter</strong> of the function object.&nbsp;If the function carrier changes more than one parameter of the function object, it means that it performs more functions.</p>
<p>Some examples of functions can be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the hammer moves the nail&nbsp;(<em>changes its position in space)</em>,</li>
<li>the glasses focus light (<em>changes its direction</em>),</li>

<section id="evaluation-of-functions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation-of-functions">Evaluation of functions</h2>
<p>Functions are evaluated in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>usefulness (categories),</li>
<li>level of performance, and</li>
<li>importance (ranks).</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions are evaluated during function modeling, and the results of this evaluation are used in subsequent steps of the analytical process. Categories and performance levels are essential for identifying the function disadvantages of the system, which serve as inputs for the cause-effect chain analysis (CECA). Function ranking&nbsp;is crucial for trimming.</p>
<section id="categories-of-functions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="categories-of-functions">Categories of functions</h3>
<p>In modern TRIZ, two categories of functions are identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>useful</strong> functions, and</li>
<li><strong>harmful</strong> functions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Useful function</strong> is a function performed by a function carrier that results in a positive (required) change or preservation a parameter of an object of the function.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Harmful function</strong> is a function performed by a function carrier that results in an inacceptable change or inacceptable preservation of a parameter of an object of the function.</em></p>
<p>Simply put, if the function carrier changes the object’s parameter in a desired direction, the function is useful; if it changes it in an undesired direction, the function is harmful.</p>
<p>Functions themselves are neither harmful nor useful. Their category must always be considered in the context of the specific situation. The function <em>hot air melts plastic</em> would be useful if the goal is to increase the plasticity of the plastic, but if the hardness of the plastic needs to be preserved, it would be a harmful function.</p>
</section>
<section id="level-of-performance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="level-of-performance">Level of performance</h3>
<p>Level of the function performance is determined only for useful functions. For harmful functions it is ignored, and they inherently represent function disadvantages of the system.</p>
<p>The level of performance determines whether the useful function is performed <strong>normally</strong> (i.e., within the intended parameters, exactly as it was designed) or is performed <strong>excessively</strong> or <strong>insufficiently</strong>. The excessive and insufficient performance of the function are viewed as&nbsp;function disadvantages of the system.</p>
<p>The performance level of a function can be illustrated by the example of a bicycle rim brake. Its purpose is to hold the tire to enable smooth and effective stopping of the bicycle. If the brake holds too tightly, the stop is too abrupt, which can lead to an accident. If the brake holds too loosely, the braking distance dangerously increases, also raising the risk of an incident.</p>
</section>
<section id="function-ranking-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="function-ranking-1">Function ranking</h3>
<p>Function ranking is conducted when it is necessary to develop an innovation strategy. It involves identifying the type of the function and then assigning it an appropriate number of points based on that type.</p>
<p>While categories&nbsp;and level of performance are the same for all types of engineering systems, function ranking is completely different for devices and processes. They are as follows:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%">
<col style="width: 33%">
<col style="width: 33%">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>function ranks for devices</strong></td>
<td><strong>function ranks for processes</strong></td>
<td><strong>score</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>basic function</td>
<td>productive function</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>additional function</td>
<td>providing function</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>auxiliary function</td>
<td>corrective function</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Function ranking plays a particularly important role in trimming for processes because the type of the function is the only factor determining which trimming rule will be applied.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-tips-on-formulating-functions">Practical tips on formulating functions</h2>
<p>Here are some practical tips on how to formulate a function correctly:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Formulate the function in the affirmative form – <em>not to do</em> something is not a function. It relates both to useful and harmful functions.</li>
<li>Do not use declarative terms (e.g.&nbsp;<em>to provide</em>, <em>to protect,</em> or <em>to seek)</em>; they do not change/maintain any parameter of the object, hence do not constitute any function.</li>
<li>Be as specific as possible.</li>
<li>If you are unable to determine the action with one verb, you can use the formula: <em>component A changes (or maintains) a parameter X of component B</em>.</li>
<li>Remember that function carrier cannot perform any function on itself. If you come across such a situation, split the object into two parts – one part will perform the the role of function carrier, the other one the role of function object.</li>

<h1>Main function</h1>
<p><em><strong>Main function</strong> is the function for which the engineering system was designed.</em></p>
<section id="overview-14" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-14">Overview</h2>
<p>An object of the main function of the engineering system is called&nbsp;target component. It always belongs to the supesystem; the engineering system cannot perform the main function on any of its components.</p>
<p>The determination of the main function and the target component depends&nbsp;on how the system’s boundaries have been defined. As we change the boundaries of the system, the main function and the target change too.</p>
<p>While a system that does not perform any main function cannot exist, there can be systems that perform several (sometimes a lot) main functions. For example, the main function of the air conditioner can be <em>to heat the air</em>, <em>cool the air</em>, <em>move moisture in or out of the air</em>, etc. Swiss army knife or a food processor perform even more main functions.</p>
<p>If there are several main functions, there may be several targets too. If the system performs several main functions, its targets can be different components of the supersystem or different main function can be directed on one target:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FA_main-function-1024x96.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The main function is something that never changes during the whole life cycle of the system. If a spoon is broken and it’s hidden in a drawer, its main function is still <em>to hold liquid</em>.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, each technical system can perform some other&nbsp;functions. For example, a chair is designed&nbsp;<em>to support a person</em>, but one can also block the door with it, hang some clothes on it, or use it to break the window during fire. However, the chair was not designed&nbsp;<em>to hold clothes</em>,&nbsp;<em>block doors,</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>break windows</em>; it was designed&nbsp;<em>to support a person</em>.</p>

<p>Both for the devices and for processes, the function model can be presented in two ways – either as a table or as a graph.</p>

<section id="function-model-as-a-table" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="function-model-as-a-table">Function model as a table</h3>
<p>For the device, the table usually contains a list of components, their functions, categories of functions (useful or harmful), the level of performance of useful functions (normal, excessive or insufficient), and a ranking of functions (basic, additional, auxiliary), which is the basis for calculating the functionality index of the components.</p>
<p>If it is necessary to calculate the functionality index, it is being included in the tabular function model. In this case the model not only contains a list of components, their functions, categories of functions, the level of performance of useful functions, but also the ranking of functions (basic, additional, auxiliary), as well as the functionality index of functions</p>
<p>In some cases, the table can be extended with additional parameters for categorizing components and functions if this helps in classifying components, e.g.&nbsp;the costs of components and their values.</p>

<section id="graph-for-a-device" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graph-for-a-device">Graph for a device</h4>
<p>To visualize the function model of the device, it is recommended that the shape and color coding for components implemented in component model be used. Additionally, shape and color coding for functions should be determined. Usually, it is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FA_fm_func-code-1024x110.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Using the proposed symbols, the example function model presented in the table in the Function model as a table section can be graphically represented the following way:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FM_fm-gr_dev-1024x229.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>When creating the graph, it is important to maintain the correct direction of the arrows representing the functions, so that they clearly indicate which component is the carrier, and which is the object of the function.</p>

<section id="graph-for-a-process" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graph-for-a-process">Graph for a process</h4>
<p>The function model of a process in the form of a graph is highly useful when it is necessary to reflect the relationships between operations – for instance, whether they are performed in parallel or sequentially. Below, we present the simplest graphical process model. It includes only functions and their categories. This information can be supplemented with additional data, such as the level of performance, rank, or the total score of the entire operation.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FA_fm-pr_graph-1024x256.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The graph represents an example of the process model described in the table above. To maintain the schematic clarity of the function graph, we used the format <em>carrier (action) object</em>. In place of <em>(action)</em>, a verb describing the specific function should be inserted, e.g., <em>carrier A moves object Z</em>, <em>carrier B holds object X</em>, etc.</p>

<h1>Function rank</h1>
<p><em><strong>Function rank</strong> is a dimensionless measure that determines the importance of the useful function.</em></p>
<section id="overview-18" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-18">Overview</h2>
<p>Function ranking is conducted when it is necessary to develop an innovation strategy.</p>
<p>Usually, it is calculated for components of the engineering system only; components of the supersystem are not ranked.</p>
<p>Ranking involves identifying the type of the function and then assigning it an appropriate number of points based on that type.&nbsp;The purpose of the scoring system is to establish relative importance among functions. The total points of all functions performed by a given component allow for calculating its functional index, which is essential for estimating the component’s value to the system. During the ranking only useful functions are considered, harmful functions are ignored. The level of performance is also not taken into account.</p>
<p>Functions are ranked for both&nbsp;devices and processes, but different criteria applied for them.</p>
</section>
<section id="function-ranks-for-devices" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="function-ranks-for-devices">Function ranks for devices</h2>
<p>The evaluation criterion here is the status of the component that is the object of the function. The function with the highest value (basic) is the one performed on the target component, i.e., the object of the main function. Functions performed on other components of the supersystem (additional) have a lower value. The least valued are the functions performed on the components of the system (auxiliary) since the primary concern is about interactions between the system and its supersystem components.</p>
<p>Functions for devices have three ranks, which are usually based on the following scoring system:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic function&nbsp;– 3 points,</li>
<li>additional function&nbsp;– 2 points,</li>
<li>auxiliary function&nbsp;– 1 point.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="function-ranks-for-processes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="function-ranks-for-processes">Function ranks for processes</h2>
<p>Applying the same criteria used for devices to functions performed in processes turns out to be impossible. In this context, neither the target component nor the supersystem components are actively utilized, even though they technically exist.</p>
<p>For processes, functions have ranks, which are usually based on the following scoring system:</p>
<ul>
<li>productive function – 3 points,</li>
<li>providing function (supporting,&nbsp;transport, or&nbsp;measurement function) – 2 points,</li>
<li>corrective function – 1 point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most valued are functions directly resulting with an irreversible change in the final product of the process (productive). Functions that help perform other functions&nbsp;but are not resulting with an irreversible change at the end of the process&nbsp;(providing)&nbsp;are slightly less important. Corrective functions have the lowest rank.</p>
<p>The algorithm for function ranking for processes can be presented in the form of the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FA_funct-alg-1024x316.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the function analysis of processes, the ranking is particularly important because what happens to a function during trimming depends closely on its rank. For devices, any rule can be applied to functions of any rank (except Rule A, which is not recommended if the removed component performs a basic function). However, for processes, there is no universal set of rules. A trimmed operation typically includes a broad set of functions, and each of them must be appropriately addressed based on its rank.</p>

<p>For example, a system consists of two components. Component 1 performs 2 basic, 1 additional, and 2 auxiliary functions and costs 5<span class="math inline">\(; component 2 performs 1 basic, 1 additional, and 1 auxiliary function and costs 2\)</span>. Value calculation is as follows:</p>

<li>1 additional function – 1 x 2pt = 2 pt.</li>

<p>The total score of both components is 16 pts.&nbsp;The normalized function score of component 1 is 10/16, and the normalized function score of component 2 is 6/16.</p>
<p>Analogous, the normalized cost can be calculated.&nbsp;The cost of component 1 is 5<span class="math inline">\(, and 2\)</span> of component 2. Together they cost 7$, so the normalized cost of component 1 is 5/7, and the normalized cost of component 2 is 2/7.</p>

<section id="overview-32" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-32">Overview</h2>
<p>The functionality index is used to calculate a component’s <a href="http://value">value</a> in the value analysis.</p>
<p>It usually depends on the number of useful functions the component performs and ranks of these functions. Originally, harmful functions were also included in the calculation, with points subtracted for their presence. Different factors were also applied to useful functions, depending on their level of performance. Some TRIZ specialists still follow this classical approach.</p>
<p>The method of calculation presented below is one of the simplest.</p>
</section>
<section id="calculating-the-functionality-index" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calculating-the-functionality-index">Calculating the functionality index</h2>
<p>Both for devices and for processes, the following steps should be performed to calculate the functionality of a component:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>identify all functions performed by the component / within the operation,</li>
<li>determine their category,</li>
<li>rank&nbsp;each useful function (eg. basic / productive – 3pts, additional / providing – 2pts, auxiliary / corrective – 1pt),</li>
<li>sum up the function points of all functions performed by the component / in th operation,</li>
<li>normalize the function score.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since harmful functions are not scored, they are not included in the calculations.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the fllowing example for a device: one of the components (component A) performs 1 harmful function and 3 useful functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 basic function (3pts), and</li>
<li>2 auxiliary functions (2 x 1pts = 2pts).</li>
</ul>
<p>The harmful function is ignored, so the total score of the component is 5pts. Let us assume that the sum of point scores for all components of the system equals 41pts. The total function index of component A equals 5/41.</p>
<p>In the same way, the functionality index for operations in processes can be calculated. For example, the sum of point scores for all operations in the process equals 132pts. Within operation X, the following useful functions are performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 productive functions (2 x 3pts = 6pts),</li>
<li>3 providing function (3 x 2pts = 6 pts), and</li>
<li>1 corrective function (1pt).</li>
</ul>
<p>The total score of the operation X is 13pts; therefore, its functionality index equals 13/132.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-33">Overview</h2>
<p>Cost analysis is typically conducted in projects aimed at reducing system costs. It is conducted simultaneously with function analysis, specifically during function modeling.&nbsp;Function analysis supplemented with cost analysis is called function-cost analysis.</p>
<p>The analysis provides crucial information about the system and its components. On one hand, it helps identify its cost disadvantages, and on the other, it aids in making decisions about which components should be considered for trimming.</p>
<p>Two types of costs can be considered during the analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>absolute cost</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;the monetary value of a component (for example, if a component costs €7, its absolute cost is €7.</li>
<li><strong>relative cost</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;the component’s cost as a percentage of the total cost of the system (for example, if the system costs €1000 and a component costs €23, its relative cost is 2,3%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using relative component costs not only makes comparison easier but also provides a more accurate assessment. A cost difference of €4 is significant if the total system cost is €13, but much less so if the system costs €2000. A high relative cost is considered a&nbsp;<strong>cost disadvantage</strong>. Cost disadvantages, along with function disadvantages, form the building blocks for cause-effect chain analysis.</p>
<p>Effects of the analysis are typically presented by adding a column to the function model table. If the project involves developing an innovation strategy, they can be used to create a function-cost diagram.</p>

<p>If the functionality index increases proportionally to the cost of the components, it indicates that the engineering system has been optimally designed. To evaluate this, try to draw a straight line between the points representing the components so that they are distributed roughly evenly around it. If successful, it suggests that the system is designed rationally; if the points are scattered widely across the area, the design leaves much to be desired. The steeper the line, the better it is for the system.</p>

<p>Flow refers to the <strong>movement</strong> of material objects (substances and energy), or information through space. What matters is its presence and motion within the engineering system under consideration, although it may also partially occur in the supersystem.</p>
<p>Dynamics (movement through space) is a key feature of flow.

<section id="overview-38" class="level2">

<p>Regardless of whether you are dealing with a device or a process, it is essential to conduct a function-cost analysis and (optionally) a flow analysis before performing CECA. Function and cost disadvantages, as well as flow disadvantages (if identified) are the fundamental building blocks of CECA, and all of them should be considered in the analysis.</p>

<section id="procedure-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure-4">Procedure</h3>
<p>Building CECA begins with the initial disadvantage formulated by inverting the goal of the project. Next, we ask the question <em>why?</em> to understand what directly causes it. Disadvantages identified in earlier analyses are typically used at the beginning of the chains. However, they can also appear in the middle or at the end of the chain, as they are not always the direct cause of the initial disadvantage.</p>
<p>As the chain progresses downward, more disadvantages are revealed, with each subsequent one serving as the cause of the previous one. Disadvantages that lie between the initial disadvantages and the key disadvantages are referred to as intermediate disadvantages.</p>
<p>The final step of the analysis is to designate certain disadvantages as key disadvantages, and it is up to you to decide which ones to select. Usually, they can be found the end of the chains, however it is not uncommon to assign the status of key disadvantage to some intermediate disadvantages.</p>

<section id="starting-and-ending-the-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="starting-and-ending-the-analysis">Starting and ending the analysis</h3>
<p>The key point in CECA is to determine where to start and when to stop the chain.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the starting point for the analysis is always the initial disadvantage.&nbsp;As for stopping the analysis, there are two main recommendations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the disadvantage is caused by a <strong>natural phenomenon</strong> (physical, chemical, biological, geometric, etc.), asking questions <em>why?</em> further is meaningless. For example, if it is needed to answer the question <em>Why does water consist of hydrogen and oxygen molecules?</em>, the answer is always *That is just the way it is**.*</li>
<li>If the cause of the disadvantage is <strong>beyond your control and influence</strong> of this project. It may be caused by administrative or legislative restrictions that cannot be circumvented (e.g., radiation level is limited by the law), project constraints may prevent from solving the problem that lies behind the disadvantage (e.g., redesigning the component associated with the disadvantage exceeds the project budget), or&nbsp;you may have no influence on the solution of the problem that is behind the disadvantage (e.g., a certain assembly cannot be redesigned since it is provided by an external supplier).</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, a chain cannot be completed because the cause of the disadvantage leads back to a previous one, creating what is known as a <strong>vicious circle</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="and-and-or-operators" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="and-and-or-operators">AND and OR operators</h3>
<p>If one disadvantage is caused by two or more disadvantages, it is necessary to use one of the operators that indicate the relationship between them:</p>
<ul>
<li>operator <strong>AND</strong> is used if at least two causes have to occur <strong>simultaneously</strong> for a disadvantage to appear; removing one of them does automatically remove the other;</li>
<li>operator <strong>OR</strong> is used if one disadvantage is caused by several factors that are <strong>independent of each other</strong>; removing one of them does not remove any other automatically.</li>
</ul>

<section id="recommendations-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommendations-2">Recommendations</h3>
<p>The technique used for building cause-effect chains involves multiple asking the question <em>why?</em>It is recommended that at least 5 levels down from the initial disadvantage be analyzed, what means that the question <em>why?</em> should be asked at least five times (that is why this tool is sometimes called a method of <strong>5 Whys</strong>).</p>
<p>It is recommended to complete the entire branch of the chain before starting the next one.</p>
<p>Note that CECA is composed of disadvantages only. Do not enter positive and advantageous effects into the chain.</p>

<p>Some of key disadvantages are directly reformulated into key problems, the others can be used in trimming.

<p>Another scenario includes performing feature transfer on the component associated with key disadvantage. It generates a set of feature transfer problems.</p>
<p>Trimming problems and feature transfer problems have the status of key problems.</p>

<p>It is recommended to examine the entire chain when selecting key disadvantages. Some disadvantages may be easy to eliminate, or certain issues might have already been resolved in the past. Consider who could assist you in this process.</p>
<p>A key disadvantage formulated around a parameter is usually easier to model using an engineering (technical) or physical contradiction. For example, if the key disadvantage is that an element is too thin, it can be relatively straightforward to model it as a physical contradiction: <em>the element should be thick because…, and it should be thin because…</em></p>
<p>Consider the disadvantages located in the branch containing the AND operator – removing one can eliminate (collapse) the entire branch or part of the chain.</p>

<h1>Trimming</h1>
<p><em><strong>Trimming</strong> is an analytical tool for improving an engineering system by removing (trimming) certain components and redistributing their useful functions among the remaining system or its supersystem components, while preserving quality and performance of the system.</em></p>
<section id="overview-42" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-42">Overview</h2>
<p>Trimming is one of fundamental analytical tools. Like feature transfer, it is a problem-generating tool since it creates problems that have never existed before. Solving these problems leads to entirely new and unexpected solutions.</p>
<p>Trimming aims to improve an engineering system by reducing the number of its components and simplifying the system. Eliminating components responsible for key disadvantages increases the system’s value by reducing its costs while maintaining or enhancing its overall functionality.</p>
<p>Trimming offers multiple options for eliminating the same component. These options represent a spectrum of possible innovations – from incremental to more radical. It also reveals a set of problems that other approaches cannot detect. It yields new problem statements, and also points toward effective solutions.</p>
<p>The input into trimming are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>function model including useful functions, developed during the function analysis, and</li>
<li>key disadvantages identified in CECA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The function model provides information about which useful functions of the trimmed components should be preserved in the system and what new carriers can be used. The key disadvantages, on the other hand, indicate components to trim, as those directly associated with key disadvantages are recommended to be removed from the system first.</p>
<p>The output of trimming is one or more trimming models, and a list of trimming problems.</p>
<p>Trimming is guided by a set of rules that determine which components to trim and/or how to redistribute their useful functions. However, a different set of rules applies to devices and another to processes.</p>
<p>In some projects, completely removing a component recommended for trimming may be impossible or impractical. In such cases, partial trimming can be applied.</p>
</section>
<section id="selecting-components-for-trimming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="selecting-components-for-trimming">Selecting components for trimming</h2>
<p>When selecting components for trimming, the decision should align with the project’s goal. If the goal is to reduce costs, consider removing the most expensive component. If minimizing weight is a priority, eliminate the heaviest one. For size reduction, focus on the largest component.</p>
<p>To determine which component to trim, it is advisable to use the following approaches:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Utilize the list of components directly linked to key disadvantages identified through CECA. This method is widely applied in most projects. By removing the component responsible for a key disadvantage, the associated issue is effectively addressed.</li>
<li>In cost-reduction projects, rely on cost assessments, such as those derived from function-cost analysis. This provides insights into the costs of units and their individual parts. When the project aims to cut costs, it is logical to trim the most expensive components.</li>
<li>For general system improvement, refer to strategies like those outlined in the function-cost diagram. One effective approach is to eliminate components with the lowest value, typically found in quadrant D of the diagram. This method helps in improving the overall system by removing elements that contribute the least value.</li>
</ol>
<p>The decision to complete the trimming process is made by the team. After removing the selected component and addressing the trimming problems, the process can be concluded or repeated for another component.</p>

<p>That rule should be used with caution. It is recommended that it be applied when the system is over-engineered and consists of too many components.</p>
<p>It is not recommended that Rule A be applied when the component being trimmed performs a basic function, because then the target must be also removed. Theoretically it is possible, but it does not happen often.</p>
<p><strong>Rule B</strong>: Function carrier can be trimmed if the object of function performs its useful function itself.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/trim_dev_rule-B-1024x132.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Rule B, sometimes referred to as the self-service rule, is less radical than Rule A. However, remember that the component that is supposed to perform a new function on itself may have limited resources, and it might be challenging to “teach” it to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Rule C</strong>: Function carrier can be trimmed if another component performs its useful function.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/trim_dev_ruleC-1024x321.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Rule C is the most frequently used scenario, since it is much easier to meet its conditions than for A or B. The system and its supersystem contain a number of components that gives a broad choice of new function carrier selection. The new function carrier should meet at least one of the four conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The component already performs an identical or similar function on the object of function.</li>
<li>The component already performs identical or a similar function on another object.</li>
<li>The component performs any function on the object of function, or it at least simply interacts with it.</li>
<li>The component has resources necessary to perform the required function.</li>
</ol>

<section id="overview-45" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-45">Overview</h2>
<p>In simple terms, partial trimming means that the component remains in the system, but redistributing some of its useful functions to other components leads to its “unloading.” This often allows for reducing the component’s cost, size, weight etc.</p>
<p>The picture below presents an example. Consider a system component (component 1) that performs three useful functions but is large and heavy. By delegating two of its functions to other component (component 3), it can be made smaller and lighter. Component 1 remains in the system, but after partial trimming, it performs only one function, and its key disadvantages – size and weight – are eliminated.</p>

<h1>Feature transfer</h1>
<p><em><strong>Feature transfer</strong> is an analytical tool for improvement of an engineering system given (base system) by transferring certain features from the alternative system (competing system) with the aim to combine the useful features in a single system.</em></p>
<section id="overview-47" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-47">Overview</h2>
<p>Feature transfer is a special tool facilitating the innovative hybridization. It has been designed to improve engineering systems (both <strong>devices</strong> and <strong>processes</strong>) by transferring desirable feature(s) from one or more feature-providing systems to the base system.</p>
<p>Like trimming, feature transfer is a problem-generating tool. It creates problems that have never existed before. Solving these problems leads to entirely new and unexpected solutions.</p>
<p>Feature transfer is a tool that not only helps reduce the cost of innovation but also minimizes the associated risks, as the required functions already exist in other engineering solutions. From another perspective, this tool expands the range of available resources for addressing key disadvantages of the analyzed engineering system.</p>
<p>Depending on the goal of the project, future transfer can be used at two different points of the analytical stage:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At the beginning of the project for <strong>new product development</strong> when it is used to hybridize the systems identified during benchmarking. This mode of hybridization usually changes the system considerably.</li>
<li>After CECA, as one of the scenarios to handle <strong>key disadvantages</strong>(trimming is the other one). This mode of hybridization does not change the system much.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ft_2options-1024x317.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The outcome of feature transfer is a set of feature-transfer problems about how to transfer one or more features.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-transfer-algorithm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-transfer-algorithm">Feature transfer algorithm</h2>
<p>Feature transfer algorithm is the following:</p>

<li>Identify the main function of the initial system /&nbsp;component that is being improved.</li>
<li>Formulate its advantages and disadvantages.</li>
<li>Identify the pool of competing systems.</li>
<li>Select an alternative system from the pool of the competing systems.</li>
<li>Select the base system out of the initial and the alternative systems (the base system is the one that was selected for improvement (transferring a feature to).</li>
<li>Use CECA to identify the feature in the alternative (feature-providing) system that can eliminate the disadvantage of the base system.</li>
<li>Formulate the feature transfer problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>When selecting alternative systems for feature transfer, multiple options may be considered. In such cases, the application of each system should be developed separately, and steps 4–7 should be repeated for each.</p>

<p>Feature transfer can be conducted at three levels of engineering complexity. Depending on project conditions, constraints, and the desired level of innovation, the following can be transferred to the base system:</p>
<ol type="1">

<p>Transferring the feature along with its physical carrier is the simplest way; however, it is characterized by the lowest level of innovation and patentability.</p>
<p>This method is quick and easy but can only be applied if the base system has enough space for the feature-providing component/system.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mixture---a-special-case-of-physical-system-integration">Mixture - a special case of physical system integration</h4>
<p>Mixture is a more advanced form of transferring a feature along with its physical carrier. This approach typically results in more innovative solutions compared to directly transferring a physical component.</p>
<p>The method involves breaking down the feature-providing component into small particles and mixing these particles with the corresponding component of the base system. From a macro-level perspective, only the base system component is recognizable, while at a micro level, the particles of the feature-providing component are also present.</p>
<p><img src="media/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ft_l2-1024x185.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Mixture is typically considered when there is not enough space in the base system for the feature-providing component. However, a key requirement is that the particles of the feature-providing component must retain the feature intended for transfer. For example, embedding magnet particles in silicone results in magnetic silicone.</p>
</section>
<section id="pure-feature-transferring" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pure-feature-transferring">Pure feature transferring</h4>
<p>For the most innovative solutions, the pure feature transfer is the most desired way.&nbsp;Transferring the feature without any physical component completely blurs the boundary between systems, making their identification no longer possible. Such solutions not only represent the highest level of innovation but also have the greatest potential for patentability.</p>

<p>Engineers naturally tend to prefer their own system as the base, either because the project aims to improve it or because it contains the component responsible for the key disadvantage. However, the final decision should be based on the project’s goals and constraints. In some cases – especially when developing a new product – it may be more beneficial to transfer the features of the initial system to an alternative system.</p>

<h1>S-curve analysis</h1>
<p><em><strong>S-curve analysis</strong> is an analytical tool based on the trend of S-curve evolution that determines where an engineering system is in its development and what steps should be taken to improve it.</em></p>
<section id="overview-53" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-53">Overview</h2>
<p>Pragmatic S-curve analysis evolved from the classical approach originally developed by Altshuller. Experience has shown that the practical application of the method based on the four indicators he proposed often poses significant challenges, and the results of such analysis are not always fully reliable.</p>
<p>In the modern approach to the S-curve, both technical and market indicators are considered essential for gaining a more comprehensive understanding of a system’s development. Key factors include the system’s market presence and the behavior of its MPV.</p>
<p>Pragmatic S-curve analysis incorporates an extensive list of indicators that enable precise identification of each stage, along with a set of strategic recommendations tailored to every phase.</p>
